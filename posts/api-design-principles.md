## The Importance of Good API Design

A well-designed API is intuitive, consistent, and easy to use. Let's explore principles that will help you create APIs developers love.

## RESTful Principles

Follow REST conventions: use HTTP methods correctly, organize resources logically, and return appropriate status codes. Consistency is crucial.

```javascript
// Good REST API design
GET    /api/users       // List users
POST   /api/users       // Create user
GET    /api/users/:id   // Get user
PUT    /api/users/:id   // Update user
DELETE /api/users/:id   // Delete user
```

## Versioning Strategy

Plan for change from day one. Implement a clear versioning strategy that allows you to evolve your API without breaking existing clients.

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users
https://api.example.com/v2/users
```

## Documentation

Great documentation is not optional. Use tools like OpenAPI/Swagger to generate interactive documentation that stays in sync with your code.

## Error Handling

Return clear, actionable error messages. Include error codes, human-readable messages, and links to documentation when possible.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
```
