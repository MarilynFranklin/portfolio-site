## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, catching errors before runtime and improving developer experience with better autocomplete and refactoring tools.

## Advanced Types

Master union types, intersection types, and conditional types. These powerful features allow you to express complex type relationships and build more robust applications.

```typescript
// Union types
type Status = 'pending' | 'success' | 'error';

// Intersection types
type User = { name: string } & { email: string };

// Conditional types
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
```

## Generic Utilities

TypeScript provides built-in utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, and Record. Learn to use these effectively to reduce boilerplate and improve type safety.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
type UserEmail = Pick<User, 'email'>;
```

## Type Guards

Use type guards to narrow types safely. Custom type guards using the 'is' keyword can make your code more type-safe and easier to understand.

```typescript
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}
```
