## CSS Has Evolved

Modern CSS offers powerful features that were once only possible with JavaScript. Let's explore the latest techniques that are changing how we style the web.

## Container Queries

Container queries allow components to adapt based on their container size, not just the viewport. This is revolutionary for component-based design systems.

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## Cascade Layers

Manage CSS specificity with cascade layers. Define clear ordering for your styles and reduce specificity wars in your codebase.

```css
@layer base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  button { padding: 0.5rem; }
}
```

## CSS Grid and Subgrid

Subgrid support is finally here! Create complex layouts where child grids can align with parent grid tracks for perfect alignment.

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.child {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```
